## Oral Disease Classifier (Custom CNN)

This project presents a deep learning model built entirely from scratch using **TensorFlow/Keras**. The model is designed to classify 7 different oral diseases [Cas,Cos,Gum,MC,OC,OT,OLP]  from image data. With careful architectural tuning, regularization, and data augmentation, the model achieves a validation accuracy of 97%, demonstrating strong performance on the task.

The notebook includes:

-Custom CNN architecture (not based on pretrained models)

-Data preprocessing and augmentation

-Training visualization (loss/accuracy plots)

-Evaluation metrics (confusion matrix, classification report)

This model serves as a baseline for further improvement or comparison with transfer learning approaches like InceptionResNetV2 or MobileNetV2.
